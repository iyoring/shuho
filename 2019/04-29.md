## OSS

### denoland/deno

ü¶ï Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.

- https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1456
  - This week I worked on this issue. I successfully wrote a custom lambda
    runtime for AWS which use Deno as language. I'm going to publish the article
    about this next week.

## MyProject

### kt3k/buttons

üå± https://buttons.kt3k.org/

`buttons` is a web service for recording the daily tasks. The users create thier
own buttons for their daily tasks and push them everyday to record when the
tasks are done.

- This week I completely migrated the backend to now 2 with
  [this PR](https://github.com/kt3k/buttons/pull/31). It was tough, but also
  fun.

## Life

### Short trip to Mito

- I went to mito this weekend. I saw a lot of plum trees and a beautiful bamboo
  forest in the park called Kairaku-en near the Mito station.

## Movie

### Avengers: Endgame

- Seen the latest of Avengers series at Tachikawa cinema city. The plot makes
  sense and the action scenes were awesome. It was definitely a great movie. But
  strangely I wasn't such impressed. Maybe something's wrong with my heart.
