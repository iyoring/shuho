## Journey

### Noto

- I went to Noto region, Ishikawa prefecture, Japan. It took about 1 hour flight
  from Haneda airport. We performed the ceremony of 32nd aniversary of our
  grandfather's passing. After that we did some sightseeing around Noto
  peninsula. We stayed there 3 days and got back to Tokyo on Friday.
- BTW Noto Airport was very small.
