## OSS

### denoland/deno

ðŸ¦• Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.

- https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1456
  - This week I continued working on this issue. I finally published the public
    lambda layer which contains working lambda deno runtime. I published an
    article about it on
    [dev.to](https://dev.to/kt3k/write-aws-lambda-function-in-deno-4b20). It got
    surprisingly many positive reactions. I thank people who asked me to write
    it.
