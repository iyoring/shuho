## OSS

### denoland/deno

ðŸ¦• Deno is a new JavaScript runtime.

- Contribution
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/1845
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/1870
  - Embedded the build arguments to deno's js bundle. `rollup-plugin-replace` worked very well for this task.

## MyProject

### kt3k/moneybit-app

ðŸ’° Moneybit is an open source mobile accounting app.

- Did some renaming of pages (edit-chart-of-accounts -> chart-settings, settings -> document-settings), and changed and cleaned up the specs of the functions of settings pages. Finally started implementing some features in chart-settings page. I hope I'll finish them in next 2 weeks.

## Event

### bokuweb.nes Tokyo

- @bokuweb, @kuy, @tsuyoshiwada, and me (@kt3k) met up at the office of UZABASE. @kuy and @tsuyoshiwada brought their favorite coffee beans and we tasted the coffee. They were very good. We talked a lot of topics about web development, OSS, development management. What I learned at this meetup includes:
  - Figma has free plan and you can share it with unlimited number of people with read access.
  - GKE has free tier. EKS doesn't.
  - dune is a modern and very nice build tool for ocaml.
  - (I did a hello world with it https://github.com/kt3k/dune-hello)
  - This book seems interesting https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/487311712
  - [RISC-V](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) seems interesting.
