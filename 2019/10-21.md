## Game

### Hinterweld

- I'm planning a new game app for mobile devices, called hinterweld. In the
  game, players move around graphs. The player uses robots for exploring the
  hinterweld. The hinterweld is almost a desert. Many unknown huge creatures
  said to be dwelling the hinterweld, but nobody actually seen them. The players
  wear heavy suit, like normal suit in Gundam, to protect themselves from the
  heat and poisonous air.
