## OSS

### denoland/deno

ðŸ¦• Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.

- Contributions
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2087
    - Added a workaround of `deno fmt` testing. `//prettier/main.ts` now doesn't work with absolute paths. Probably we need to fix glob function of fs module to resolve it completely.
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2100
    - Restored `window.File`.

### c3js/c3

ðŸ“Š C3 is a chart library based on D3.

- https://github.com/c3js/c3/pull/2595
  - @FreezinG117 contributed the new chart `Stanford diagram`. This was a huge contribution. We haven't added a new chart for several years to c3js. This was a great enhancement.

- TBD
