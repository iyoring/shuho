### denoland/deno

ðŸ¦• Deno is a new JavaScript runtime.

- Contribution
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/1773
  - Added `env` option to `run` API. With this change, we can add the environment variables to subprocesses.

- Global `Deno` variable
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/1748
  - One big change landed this week. With the above change, we can access deno's API through global variable `Deno`. This opens a way to write a univeral module which works both in browsers and in deno, even when it uses deno's API.
