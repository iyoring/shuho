### c3js/c3

ðŸ“Š C3 is a chart library based on D3.

- @masayuki0812 and me met in person in the Enechange office together with several other guests. It was a nice wrap-up of c3.js.

### capsid-popper

ðŸŽˆcapsid-popper is a capsid module which behaves as a [popper][] component.

- [popper][] is, in my view, a very important frontend library in 2019. It places the elements relative to the other elements. `capsid-popper` is a wrapper of the library using [capisd][]. This week I enhanced the function of capsid-popper. `popper` has a lot of options, but capsid-popper didn't support almost any of them. I added `data-popper-modifier` attribute handling to it. So now you can configure any of popper [modifiers](https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#modifiers).

[capsid]: https://capsid.js.org/
