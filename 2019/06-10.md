### denoland/deno

ðŸ¦• Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.

- This week version 0.9.0 has been released, which includes `deno install`
  subcommand. Now we can install the standalone cli as follows:

```console
$ deno install file_server https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts --allow-net --allow-read
```

## MyProject

### kt3k/moneybit-app

ðŸ’° Moneybit is an open source mobile accounting app.

- I made a little progress on `delete`-modal in chart-settings page. Now I
  realized I have 3 different approaches for creating modal in this app (feeling
  a little silly). Comparing these 3, I decided to follow the one used in
  `title-area` of document-settings page, which has the most encapsulated
  design. It is single event, single dom approach. The overlay shadow is the
  container of modal dialog. The other two have separate overlay shadows and
  modal dialog doms. The former is simpler, but less flexible. The latters are
  more complex, but more flexible.

## Job

### goroutine leaks

- At @seqsense, we use Go language in many places. Though I first joined this
  team as a frontend engineer, but now I help implementing the data collector
  agent in Go language. This week I first experienced I leaked a goroutine.
  Thanks to @t-asaka's review, that leak has never been deployed to the actual
  device, but it was about to be shipped and I really didn't realize it leaked.

```go
func Foo() {
  ...
  for _, item := range list {
    go func(item Item) {
      c <- doNetworkJob(item)
    }(item)
  }

  for range list {
    err <- c
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

I supposed this worked like something JavaScript equivalent of:

```js
function foo() {
  ...
  try {
    await Promise.race(list.map(doNetworkJob))
  } catch (e) {
    throw e
  }
  ...
}
```

But it actually isn't. This leaks the gorouines after leaving the function `Foo`
because the channel `c` looses the receiver and `c <- doNetworkJob(item)` blocks
forever!

### MIB: International

- Seen Men In Black: International. I liked the hammer scene.
