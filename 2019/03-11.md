## MyProject

### kt3k/moneybit-app

ðŸ’° Moneybit is an open source mobile accounting app.

- The tooltip for editing the chart of account now becomes the capsid component and it can handle edit event and delete event. Next week I'm going to implement modal dialog for renaming the account title. It's very slow progress, but it's very important not to stop doing my own project.

## Life

### Tax document

- March 15 was the deadline of tax filing for the fiscal year 2018 in Japan. I was very busy collecting information, documents, and receipts to complete the form this week. I finished creating the document and submitted to the tax office of Tachikawa on March 14. This was the 4th time I submitted the tax document as a freelancer. I used my command-line tool [moneybit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moneybit) for making the balance sheet from the journal, which is necessary to make the financial statements, a part of tax document. This tool is the basis of the above application moneybit-app.
