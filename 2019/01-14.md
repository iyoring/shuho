## OSS

### denoland/deno

ü¶ï Deno is a new TypeScript and JavaScript runtime.

- Contribution
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/1528
  - Replaced format.py (python) with format.ts (deno). It was a fun task.

## MyProject

### kt3k/moneybit-app

üí∞ Moneybit is an open source mobile accounting app.

- Wrote some test cases of subledger-modal. It was a considerably hard task. I felt something's wrong about the interface of this component. Probably I the abstraction of dom tree is not enough, and the abstract of domain is not enough either. I need some improvement in this construction in future.

## Event

### deno „ÇÇ„Åè„ÇÇ„Åè‰ºö 2

- We, Japanese deno enthusiasts, gathered in CUUSOO system's office. (Thanks @kazupon for the venue!) Everybody worked on their own task around deno and there were lots of progresses. We also had many conversation about deno and there were lots of interesting stuff. I gave [a talk](https://kt3k.github.io/deno_talk_1/) (in Japanese) about the (still short) history of deno. The slides were very imcomplete, but the audiences showed strong interest on each detail of the talk and it became really meaningful time thanks to them. I had really fun time.
