### denoland/deno

🦕 Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.

- Contributions
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2591
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/pull/527
    - I'm working on the breaking updates of the Reader interface. This is one
      of the necessary features for v1.0. It compiles and passes the tests, but
      it has a little anomaly in `deno types` output. I'm still trying to solve
      it.

## Job

### G20

- Our robot `SQ2` was displayed in G20 summit in Osaka. I didn't go to the
  venue, but many pictures appeared which showed SQ2 there. I liked the one
  which showed SQ2, our manager Sungjae Kim, and Taro Kono the Minister of
  Foreign Affairs.

## Event

### ReactJS Tokyo

ReactJS Tokyo is a meetup of react users in Tokyo.

- React users gathered in Mercari's office in Roppongi on Wednesday and listened
  to the talks about React. My ex-colleague @taneba presented his experience
  about `react-testing-library`. I liked his technique to create the report of
  the test specs and share it to non-engineers. That process seemed promising.

### [#tng34](https://nodejs.jp/events/2019/06-27-tng34)

🐢 Tokyo Node Gakuen is a Japanese local conference of Node.js users.

- We had 34th Tokyo Node Gakuen in Gran Tokyo South Tower on Thursday. This time
  was a special conference for the reports from JSConf EU 2019. @yosuke-furukawa
  talked about the package managers. We had 3 major updates from package
  managers: Tink, Yarn v2, and Entropic. Tink and yarn seemed heading for the
  similar directions, but entropic seemed having a very different goal. They all
  proposes very different way of managing node.js programs. I can't say which is
  better, but anyway they all try to change the node ecosystem significantly.
  @dorayakikun talked about the Workers, which is the service for edge computing
  by CloudFlare. @leko talked about the history of Web API adoptions in node.js.
  @akito0107 presented his own tool
  [marron-glace](https://github.com/akito0107/marron-glace), which is a very
  typescript-friendly option parser. Talks were fantastic and the party was nice
  as well.

### #deno_ja 5th

🦕🇯🇵 `#deno_ja` is a Japanese local meetup of Deno enthusiasts.

- This time we gathered at the office of LoiLo Inc. We talked about the recent
  changes of Deno and each person worked on their own issues. @hashrock worked
  on his delectron, a tool like electron, but written in Deno. @locol23 created
  the bundle script by `deno bundle` and successfuly rendered the DOM using
  react, crazy work. In the meeting, we decided to join the TechBookFest 7 (22th
  Sep, 2019), and registered to it. I brought there the stickers I created the
  last week and they were so popular.
