## Game

### Dragon Quest Walk

- Started playing a new social game "Dragon Quest Walk".

## Movie

### Once upon a time in Hollywood

- Seen a movie "Once upon a time in Hollywood". Directed by Tarantino, starred
  by Leonard DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. I liked the role Pitt played.

## Politics

### We are going right

- These days it seems to me that Japanese society is going to very very right.
  Less and less people seem critical to the government, and if a person is
  critical to the recent politics againt Korea, then that person will be
  criticized intensely from every direction. I think the media were more
  critical to the government by default at least a few years ago. However it
  seems now very difficult for a public person in media to be critical to the
  government. I'm not sure whether it's controlled by someone or it's just
  naturally in this way, but anyway I feel strongly that it's different from
  what it used to be in a few years ago in Japan.
- Maybe we're changing our values for some reasons. Some good things go bad now,
  and some bad things go good now. I just need to adjust myself to fit those
  values to live with them because I just don't want to fight with them
  politically.
