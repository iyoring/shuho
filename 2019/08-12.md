  - Still writing the chapters of the book for beginners. This task is really
    time-and-energy-consuming. I'm not sure this is worth it.
  - I compared many JavaScript introduction books in Japanese.

## Job

### seqsense/aws-iot-device-sdk-go

- https://github.com/seqsense/aws-iot-device-sdk-go/pull/39
  - I've been working on a task to refactor the publishing behavior of AWS IoT's
    mqtt client. The original implementation enqueued the message when the
    offline queueing option is true. However that feature is supported by the
    underlying paho client because that's a part of MQTT spec (QoS >= 1). So in
    this task, I'm removing that original queueing behavior and instead using
    the paho's feature correctly.
