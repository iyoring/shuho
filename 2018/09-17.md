### babel

### c3

- Slow progress. Keep reading the issues. Did a small refactoring. I want to address #2458 for the next iteration. #2483 can be easily addressed and should be done soon.

## MyProject

### kt3k/buttons

https://github.com/kt3k/buttons

`buttons` is a web service which shows the buttons of *daily habits* and the user push them everyday when they finished the task, and the records are shown as a calendar.

- Wrote the tests of the `PUT /users/self/id` API.
- Added the check of the availability of the display id. No same ids for different users 👍
- The next step: Write `/users/self/buttons` APIs. They can be done in very TDD manner now because every set up is ready now. Now I can do very robust and quick iterations on creating the APIs.

## Math

### Math notebook

https://github.com/kt3k/math-exercises-notes

## Events

### roppongi.js

https://roppongi-js.connpass.com/event/98983/

- It was the 2nd time to come to the roppongi.js. Went the venue with @38fanjia. Greeted with @Leko and @kuy. @sadnessOjisan's talk about z-index and stack context seemed getting popular there. I talked with @Yug1224 and @jaxx2104 for a while after the presentations.
