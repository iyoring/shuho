## OSS

### denoland/deno

- 1.0.0 was released. The release blog revealed many things such as the plan of rewriting TSC with Rust, etc.

  I was acknowledged at the end of the article as well as other major contributors. Maybe this was something I was looking for during following the development of Deno. When I first started using Node.js in 2012 in GREE, the initial development of Node.js looked legendary to me. I wonder what it feels like to join the initial development of such widely used software. That was one of the motivation I joined the development of Deno. Now I was acknowledged as the 6th most contibuted member of Deno. Now I have both very satisfied feelings and very unsatisfied feelings. Maybe I will write about them in some future somewhere.

  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/5276

    I was trying to address the issue [#5069](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/5069). It was interesting to use bundle feature in a different place in rust code. It's been almost finished, but I haven't check the behavior in windows. To check it, I tries to obtain an windows machine but I couldn't find any good one in Yodobashi or Bic cameras. So I changed my mind, and I decided to use EC2 windows instance for the first. I'm still setting it up.

## Life

### Iyo

- Iyo scrambled at night on Tuesday because she forgot to prepare for the liquor return which was necessary for closing the shop in her franchise. I was impressed by her sense of responsibility. She immediately admitted her own fault and tried to recover the mistake out of her work time.

## Hobby

### Camera

- Iyo loves cameras very much. This weekend we went to Marunouchi to take my portrait photography. Her photographic skill was very high level. I loved it very much.
