  - Signal Handler

    https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/3757

    Finally finished signal handler PR 🎉 Probably this was the toughest PR I've ever worked on the Open Source space. The implementation was tough. The designing was tough. The toughest part was learning rust and tokio. It was really difficult to get the idea of what tokio does. I thank the reviewers of that PR. Without the help from them, it wasn't possible for me to finish it.

### yarnpkg/berry

- Yarn team announced the stable beta of yarn 2 (berry). It seems very different from yarn 1. There seems a contravacy on how to accept this tool. Some demand the authors to change the name of it.

## Life

### Anker Nebula Capsule II

- Bought a nice project from Anker. I chose to buy a projector instead of TV because it saves the space.
