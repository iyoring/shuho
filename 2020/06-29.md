### Movie

- Seen a Netflix original movie, Bad Batch. The first sequence were amazing, but the later part were not as good as the first part. It illustrates a type of dystopia, where "bad" people forcely placed in and there doesn't exist law in a usual sense. Barbarian leaders rule people in barbarian ways. The setting was totally overwhelming, and I was impressed.
