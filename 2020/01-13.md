  - Optional Async Op

    https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/3715

    Started solving optional async op problem. This was very difficult for me to implement. I had to learn lots of things about Rust and Tokio. I now feel I got definitely better at Rust now.

    Though the implementation was finished for now, we are still a little contraversial about whether this is actually necessary. We probably need to discuss a little bit further.
