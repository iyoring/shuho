## Tech

### React Native

- Bought the book, React Native, written by @januswel, @YutamaKotaro, and @nitaking. It's a very nice, modern and practical introduction to React Native. It also covers the modern basic topics like TypeScript and ES6+. It's definitely a book I can recommend to anybody who consider starting creating cross platform apps.

## MyProject

### Tententen

Tententen is a mobile generative art app. https://github.com/monoidcc/Tententen

- Resumed the development of Tententen. This week I researched about available fonts on Android devices. The available fonts on Android were very different from those of iOS. The web site called [wordmark.it](https://wordmark.it) was very helpful for finding out what was available on Android.

## Life

### New room

- We're looking for a new room these days. This weekend we went to Azabu for seeing the inside of a candidate room which we've been considering about. It was a very nice room, had lots of nice storages. The living room was nice and big enough. The entrance and corridor were very nice and like a fancy hotel.

### A dress

- Iyo bought a new summer dress. It was very nice and I really loved it :)
