### denoland/deno

- Deno switched its internal TypeScript into JavaScript this week. The team even dropped the usages of `import` and instead we simply concat the all files. Personally I think this isn't the way to write JavaScript in 2020 and the benefit seems a little obscure compared to its disadvantages ü§î

### `poly_soft` article

- YouTuber Tech speaker `@poly_soft` wrote a confusing and contraversial [article](https://qiita.com/poly_soft/items/712da982eedf65066fdb) this week. He compares learning technologies to the street fighting and he argue that such type of learning will be meaningless eventually and that an engineer needs to figure out a different way to earn more presence in the society other than just learning technology.

### OIDC

- I was learning about OpenID Connect for a long time for researching the feasibility of google authentication of AWS AppSync from expo application. I finally got an `id_token` of google from my expo client this week. It was really hard time to get the right parameters for my need.

## Life

### Phone

- My phone, Pixel 3a, has been dead this week because of falling from my hand in a bus. This is my first time to break a phone completely by dropping it from my hand. I bought Huawei nova lite 3 instead. It costed just 20,000 yen and it works nicely for the moment ‚ò∫Ô∏è
