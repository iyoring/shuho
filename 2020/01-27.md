  - `Deno.signal` takes multiple args

    https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/3857

    @axetroy suggested that Deno.signal should take multiple arguments in [#3773](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/3773). So I implemented it. Before doing this, I created an independent utility, [mux-async-iterator](https://github.com/kt3k/mux-async-iterator), which works for both node.js and deno.

## Life

### Switch

- I've played splatoon for the first time in my new room. Playing in the screen projected on the wall was a new experience to me.

## Event

### Light Cafe Creation Talk

- I talked about code reviews in Light Cafe Creation in Hatchobori. There were many feedbacks from the audience after the talk. It was really a great time.

### koenji.dev

- I joined koenji.dev on Thursday. I met @kawasima, @soudai, @mizchi, @mala, and many others there. Very small meetup, but many great guys. I've seen @mala in real for the first time. He is a legendary frontend engineer in Japanese tech scene. He now works in LINE, doing security jobs.
