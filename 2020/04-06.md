## MyProject

### Tententen

https://github.com/monoidcc/Tententen

- Continued working on Tententen. This week I finished `@lepont/share` module and started implementing it in Tententen. I almost finished `share` feature. Here is the video:

  After that, I started testing in Android simulator and my own device. I found that Andoird's webview has very few number of fonts installed. Now I'm investigating the available fonts in Android webview.

## Society

### Coronavirus

- The effect of COVID-19 is now so huge. The prime minister declared a state of emergency. More and more shops started stopping the operation all day. Many shops only operate limited hours. There are really few cafes out there which operate today. The situation is now very uncomfortable to live 😞 Fortunately there are no shortage of foods and daily goods. So there is no threat of life for now, but anyway it's very strange time in my life.

## Life

### Hobby

Drawing of masks

- I started distributing masks digitally. This week I made 8 masks for my twitter and github friends.
