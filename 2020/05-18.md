    To validate the above branch, I was trying to build Deno on windows (again) this week. This time I decided to build it in EC2 instance because I don't have windows machine and I don't need it except validating some of the fixes which happened in OSS developments like this one.

    I was struggling with it all the week, but finally I managed to build it at the end of the week. The last error I solved for building it was the target triple of rust language. I first used [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) for installing Rust. It's so easy as just hitting the command `scoop install rustup`. But it was a wrong approach because `scoop install rustup` installs with target triple of `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` and that triple wasn't supported by `rusty_v8`. We need to use `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` for building `rusty_v8`. So what I need to do was uninstalling rustup of scoop and reinstall it through the official rustup installer.

## Hobby

### Camera

## Life

### House

- I've been looking for a new house for living with Iyo these days. We're maybe going to apply to one of the rooms near Shiba Park next week.

### COVID-19

- The emergency situations were dismissed in many prefectures this week except 4 including Tokyo. Many shops started operting these days and now it's expected that all the emergency situations will be dismissed next week by the government. So maybe we're going to be as normal as before the pandemic started in around March.

  We had lunch in ShakeShack in Shinjuku on Saturday. It felt like a normal Saturday as before the COVID-19 spreading.
