## MyProject

### Tententen

https://github.com/monoidcc/Tententen

- Continued working on Tententen.

### capsid

https://github.com/capsidjs/capsid

- Restart the maintainance of capsid. Mondernized the test structure. This time added `@is` decorator, which adds the given class to the element at the mount timing. If you use it with `css` tagged template literal you can do the thing like the below:

  ```js
  @component('foo')
  @is(css`
    position: absolute;
    ...
  `)
  class Foo { ... }
  ```

## Event

### deno-ja

- deno-ja had a meet-up online on Sunday (@keroxp, @syumai, and me). We talked about random things about deno. We like the vscode plugin of @axetroy very much.
