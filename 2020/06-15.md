## Life

### New room

- The application of the room passed their examination quite smoothly. It was a little different from what I went through during the application of the current house in Koenji. I need to prepare lots of documents to pass it. This time examination passed very easily with very few documents. Maybe it was because we are two this time and Iyo works in a big company.
