## MyProject

### Tententen

- This week I designed a little of the main page of Tententen app. Design means the layout and placement of buttons and controls in this context. I felt actually this process was a little boring because there was no right answer about it and each solution is very similar. So I can't find any reasoning from my choice that my answer is better than the others. That's a little painful point 😕

## Tech

### IE11

- Twitter finished supporting IE11 this week. This would be one of the big events in the history of IE and therefore the history of web browsers. This might accelerate the sunsetting of the IE, which would cause the very big leap of the evolution of the web.

## Life

### New room

- Paid the initial fee for the new room! 🎉

### Nameko

- Iyo and me started nameko game again. This was a phenomenal mobile game in Japan some years ago. It's easy and pleasant to play. A nice pass time for relaxing our minds.
